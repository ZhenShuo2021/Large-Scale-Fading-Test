# Large-Scale-Fading-Test
Not 100% sure, contact me if you have any comment.
## Fading and Noise Unit?
School lessons won't tell you the noise unit, it only says "SNR is equal to Eb over N0 if you set Eb=1", 
however some paper uses the fading like dBm/Hz or noise spectrum density that you never heard in class.
There aren't any code with receive signal under LSCF I found on the internet. 
This file is to provide an implementation of LSCF faded signal. 

## However I'm NOT 100% sure it's correct.
